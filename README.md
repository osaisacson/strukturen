- change the name of example-env in the root of your project to env.js and (IMPORTANT) include it in your gitignore file.
- in firebase, go to project settings and find your project details. Update the account details in env.js
- delete all specific firebase files in root, these will be generated in the next step
- `firebase init` - select installing all options. Follow all defaults apart for functions, do not overwrite these.
- In firebase project settings download the google-services.json file from your apps/android and the GoogleService-Info.plist from your apps/iOS, add these to the root of your project
